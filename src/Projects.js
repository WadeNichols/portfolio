          This was the very first big project that we were assigned; a test at
          our front end skills. We had 10 days to complete this and I enjoyed
          this one the most. I was able to see what I could do with the new
          skills Iâ€™ve learned and combine them with my love to play the guitar.

          I enjoyed working on the first project so much, I decided to continue
          it. I started from scratch and was able to clean my code up a little
          and try a few different things. This is definitely one that I will
          continue to work on during my free time to see where I can take it. I
          have ideas of what I would like to add to it and develop it even more.

          Cursive Clothing Company - This was our final project; it also is a
          full-stack application but we were required to have Authentication. We were given 8
          days and we had to work with a partner which made it more of a
          challenge. Both of us had different ways of interpreting information
          and how we approached it. This gave me a great learning experience
          with a team and true collaboration in our efforts to complete a
          project. It was a great learning experience and good practice for
          working in the real world, working in pairs or groups.

          I am proud of these projects and accomplishments I've achieved in
          these past few months. I began my journey with little to no knowledge
          of the coding world and finished with head full of new knowledge,
          ideas and tools to get me started. We had a deadline with all of these
          apps, averaging between 6-9 days to complete them. I am excited for
          the future and to see how much more I can grow and learn with these
          new skills that I've been taught.
