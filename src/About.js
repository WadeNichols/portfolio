          Hi, I'm Wade and this is the story of how I met your mother.
          <br />
          Oops, thats the wrong story; this is a explanation to why you might be
          reading this.

          A lot of my past work experience were jobs that just got me by. They
          were jobs such as paper routes, working in restaurants, customer
          service and, most recently, construction. None of these meant a whole
          lot to me and . It's not that i hated any of the jobs or the work i
          did but i didn't have any passion for them. I had them to pay the rent
          or, when i was younger, to buy my toys. Electronics were always
          something i was interested in; now days i can spend hours in Best Buy
          just looking at their products, especially the computers/tablets and
          phones. When i was 14 years old and had my own paper route, one of the
          things i bought was my very own desktop. I had saved up for a while
          and when i finally was able to purchase it i was like a kid in a candy
          shop. I loved being on my computer and just messing around with it and
          i became very familiar with it.

          I never did anything with that interest after high school and i always
          regretted it. As i kept taking on more and more responsibilities it
          seemed to become more and more difficult to go back to school to
          pursue my interest in technology, specifically computers. As time kept
          going it kept weigh me down that i never did anymore education after
          HS and i was starting to give up on the idea when one day i got the
          push i needed to do something to better myself and to better my life.
          So i did my research and once i mad the decision i quit my job the
          next day so that i could attend a Fullstack Web Developer boot camp in
          Salt Lake City, UT. my home town. I spent three months at this full
          time boot camp going from knowing nothing about coding to having the
          knowledge and tools i need to do something better with my life and
          pursue my interests that i nearly left behind.

          So this is where i am at now; I am enthused to begin this new journey
          in my life and doing something that gives me joy or drives me out of
          my mind but that can be fixed with a 15 minute walk.
          <br />
          Graduating V-School is a major accomplishment in my life and I'm proud
          of myself. I didn't think coding would be easy but i soon discovered
          that this was going to be a challenge, so: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! I am
          excited to embrace this new chapter and see where its going to take
          me. Feel free to poke around my portfolio to see a little of what i
          learned.
